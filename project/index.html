                    <p>
                        Jonathan Edwards was an American revivalist preacher, philosopher, and
                        Congregationalist Protestant theologian. Like most of the Puritans,
                        he held to the Reformed theology.

                        Jonathan Edwards was born on October 5, 1703 and was the son of Timothy Edwards (1668 - 1759),
                        a minister at East Windsor, Connecticut (modern day South Windsor), who eked out his salary by
                        tutoring boys for college. His mother, Esther Stoddard, daughter of the Rev. Solomon Stoddard,
                        of Northampton, Massachusetts, seems to have been a woman of unusual mental gifts and independence
                        of character. Jonathan, their only son, was the fifth of 11 children. He was trained for college
                        by his father and elder sisters, all of whom received an excellent education and one of whom, Esther,
                        the eldest, wrote a semi-humorous tract on the immateriality of the soul, often mistakenly
                        attributed to Jonathan.

                        On July 8, 1731, Edwards preached in Boston the "Public Lecture" afterwards published under the title
                        "God Glorified in the Work of Redemption, by the Greatness of Man's Dependence upon Him, in the Whole
                        of It," which was his first public attack on Arminianism. The emphasis of the lecture was on God's
                        absolute sovereignty in the work of salvation: that while it behooved God to create man pure and without
                        sin, it was of his "good pleasure" and "mere and arbitrary grace" for him to grant any person the
                        faith necessary to incline him or her toward holiness, and that God might deny this grace without any
                        disparagement to any of his character. In 1733, a Protestant revival began in Northampton and
                        reached an intensity in the winter of 1734 and the following spring,
                        that it threatened the business of the town. In 6 months, nearly 300 were admitted to the church.
